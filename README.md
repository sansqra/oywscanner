# OYW QRScanner (Final)

One of my first live projects along with a framework that was barely used. 🤓

OYW is an event that happens at Our Lady of Lourdes Church, and it decided to go paperless. The ticketing system went digital,
and I was lucky to be part of the team. This app is what I was tasked to make.

It's not written in industry standards because I was a noob in Flutter then, but it was fun doing it. 💖💖

You can check the ticket issuing system code over at my friend's repository. Written with love 💖 in Flask: 🙌🙌
