# Final OYW Scanner

One of my first live projects along with a framework that was barely used.

OYW is an event that happens at Our Lady of Lourdes Church, and it decided to go paperless. The ticketing system went digital,
and I was lucky to be part of the team. This app is what I was tasked to make.

It's not written in industry standards because I was a noob in Flutter then, but it was fun doing it.

You can check the ticket issuing system code over at my friend's repository. Written in Flask and React.js:
